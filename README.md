# Insurit
This is my end of academic year data science project, which consists of developing a desktop application that can generate a car insurance contract by just uploading a picture of your identity card and car registration card using EasyOCR.

The data science methodology used in this project is the IVM master plan.

Such data is hard to find since it's confidential so fake data was generated using the Pandas library.

You can find in the INSURIT.ipynb the pipeline from data preprocessing until the contract generation.
